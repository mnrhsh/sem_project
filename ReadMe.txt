Good day lecturer, 

If lecturer tried to run the code for sign up for service provider or runner but still did not receive the mail, 
lecturer can change code line 183,184,274,275 at BusinessServicesLayer/userController/userController.php to lecturer's email and email password.
The email must be valid and in gmail.

After that, lecturer need to login to the gmail that updated in the code just now to change the setting, 
1. click >> Manage your Google Account
2. left hand side click >> Security
3. Scroll down to >> Less secure app access
4. Change it to >> On

this is for allowing the php mailer to login the email and send mail.

Reminder: Admin need to approve service provider and runner before they login.

For admin to login,
Admin email : sdwsec4grp5@gmail.com
Admin password : sec4grp5

For sandbox Paypal account login,
email : sb-v6bam2601360@personal.example.com
password : 3BYH)6nd

If lecturer still face any issues kindly whatsapp me at 016-3543268 (Than Hong Yue)
Thank you.
